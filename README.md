# ByteData API

## Overview

ByteData API is an advanced Java library designed to streamline the conversion and manipulation of various data types into a unified `ByteData` format. This proprietary data abstraction facilitates the seamless aggregation of disparate data forms into a singular byte array, optimizing data serialization and deserialization processes for efficient storage and transmission.

## Features

-   **Data Aggregation:** Consolidate multiple data types into a compact `ByteData` structure, reducing complexity and enhancing manageability.
-   **Custom Serialization:** Implement custom serialization strategies tailored to specific data requirements, ensuring optimal performance and flexibility.
-   **Efficient Deserialization:** Retrieve original data types from `ByteData` with precision and minimal overhead, maintaining data integrity and usability.
-   **Type Safety:** Leverage Java's type system to enforce data consistency and safety during conversion processes, minimizing runtime errors and data corruption.
-   **Extensibility:** Designed with extensibility in mind, allowing for easy incorporation of new data types and serialization strategies to meet evolving project needs.
